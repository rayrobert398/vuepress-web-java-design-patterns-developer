# Introduction

Design patterns are the best formalized practices a programmer can use to
solve common problems when designing an application or system.

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven
development paradigms.

Reusing design patterns help prevent subtle issues that cause major
problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who
are familiar with the patterns.

# Getting started

This site showcases Java-based design patterns, principles, and code snippets. The 
solutions have been developed by experienced programmers and architects from the 
open source community. The patterns can be browsed by their high level descriptions 
or by looking at their source code. The source code examples are well commented and 
can be thought as programming tutorials on how to implement a specific pattern. We 
use the most popular battle-proven open source Java technologies.

Hopefully you find the object oriented solutions presented on this site useful
in your architectures and have as much fun learning them as we had developing them.
